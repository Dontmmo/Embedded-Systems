# Embedded-Systems
This repo is for doing Embedded Systems projects and Upload I hope I am gonna keep on and build Good Projects and useful for my career. 
I will be using AVR atmega32 for starting and till I finish learning basics of another micro controller (probably STM) I will use it in my projects.
